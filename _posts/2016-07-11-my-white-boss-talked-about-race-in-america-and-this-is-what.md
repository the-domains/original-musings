      One of the difficulties in reacting rationally to the #BlackLivesMatter
      movement is the fierce conviction borne of personal experience. The
      Internet is now full of young activists telling their stories of
      #DrivingWhileBlack - stories that often feature some combination of a
      belligerent police officer, a defiant citizen, and the deeply held belief
      that white people like me enjoy a privileged interaction with police, one
      that insulates us from the consequences of our own mistakes.

  I am a Black woman. Not only that, I am a Black woman working in tech, one of
  the most homogeneous industries ever birthed. As a woman in tech, I account
  for 30% of the tech workforce. As a Black person in tech, I account for 5% of
  the tech workforce.
