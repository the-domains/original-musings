> 1/ The logic of violence determines the structure of society. ("The Sovereign Individual" thesis)

> 2/ It is easier to take than to create. Social structure emerges from the predator-prey relationship between makers and takers.

> 3/ Hunter gatherer age: No land, no possessions, axes and spears. Rule by Tribes

> 4/ Agricultural age: Land & possessions emerge, hard to defend. Feudal lords run protection racket, hierarchical society. Rule by Kings.

> 5/ Industrial Age: Armies with guns and vulnerable factories require consolidation of power. Rule by Nation-states

> 6/ Nuclear Age: Nuclear weapons create Mutually-Assured-Destruction. Large-scale peace and small-scale war. Rule by Superpowers

> 7/ Information Age: Tectonic shifts in costs of violence and returns to violence on horizon.

> 8/ Info Age: Guns become trivial to create & distribute. 3D Printing becomes Printing Press for guns. Ease of offense & defense increase.

> 9/ Info Age: Connected cameras. Every violent action filmed and broadcast. Returns to violence decline (except terrorism, where they rise).

> 10/ Info Age: Miniaturized drones will render battlefield systems obsolete. Dominates aircraft, infantry, armor. Trivializes assassinations.

> 11/ Information Age: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies make wealth difficult to seize

> 12/ Information Age: Rise of mental labor over physical labor reduces returns to conquering people and territories.

> 13/ Information Age: Virtual Reality worlds create infinite land. Returns to conquering territory declines further.

> 14/ Future: Money becomes information. Weapons become information. Land becomes information. Software eats society.

> 15/ Future: Remaining violence is mostly secessionist / self determinist in nature. Expect many more smaller states.

> 16/16: Far future: In a perfect Virtual Reality world, we all live in governments of one. Fin.
